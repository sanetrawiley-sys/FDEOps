# business-case - Build the business case

**Context:** apply [task context and evidence](task-context.md) before using the named records below.

**Enter when:** the sponsor needs justification for the next phase, the FDE needs to defend budget or timeline, a feature decision needs cost/benefit evidence, or poc produced a direction that needs funding.

**Read first:** `reality.md`, `success.md`, `delivery.md`, `context.md`. Load `business-case.md` from poc if it exists - extend it, don't restart.

Technical FDEs lose engagements by shipping good code without business justification. The sponsor's boss doesn't ask "is the code clean?" - they ask "what did we get for the money?" A business case translates technical work into the language that keeps the engagement alive.

## Method (you do this work)

**1. Name the cost of doing nothing.** This is the anchor. Every business case starts not with what you'll build, but with what it costs them to leave the problem unsolved:

| Cost type | How to find it | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Labor capacity / direct spend** | Ask: "What does this problem cost per month in money?" | Manual reconciliation hours × loaded rate = capacity value; separately identify reducible spend |
| **Opportunity cost** | Ask: "What can't you do because of this problem?" | Can't onboard enterprise clients because the API can't handle their volume |
| **Risk cost** | Ask: "What happens if this breaks at the worst time?" | A payment processing outage during Black Friday = $X/hour in lost sales |
| **Velocity cost** | Measure: deployment frequency, lead time, change failure rate | Team ships once/month instead of once/week; each delay = N features not reaching customers |

**2. Build the driver model.** Not a spreadsheet - a logic chain the sponsor can trace:

```
Investment: <hours × rate, or fixed cost>
  → Delivers: <specific outcome from success.md>
    → Benefit: <capacity released, avoidable cash spend, revenue, or risk reduction>
      → Net cash: realizable incremental cash benefit - full costs over <time horizon>
```

Keep drivers, units, sources, and ranges explicit. For example, 3 people × 8h/week × $75/h × 52 weeks = $93.6K/year of labor capacity value. It is cash savings only if spend actually falls (for example, paid overtime or a contractor cost ends). Name who can realize the benefit and how. Include build, ongoing operation, adoption, and transition costs; avoid double-counting capacity and revenue enabled by the same hours. Do not calculate cash payback from capacity value alone.

**3. Sensitivity check - name the two drivers that swing the result:**

Every business case has 1-2 variables where a small change flips the outcome. Name them explicitly:

> "The capacity case assumes the team reclaims 6 hours/week per person. At 3 hours, that benefit halves. Cash payback remains unproven until finance identifies avoidable spend. Validate time-spent before and after the pilot with representative team members."

The sponsor who sees you've identified where the case could break trusts the case more, not less.

**4. Frame for the audience.** Different stakeholders need different lenses on the same case:

| Audience | Lead with | Avoid |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **CFO / finance** | ROI, payback period, cash flow impact | Technical architecture, feature lists |
| **CTO / engineering** | Technical debt retired, velocity improved, risk reduced | Revenue projections they can't verify |
| **CEO / founder** | Strategic enablement, competitive edge, customer impact | Detailed calculations (give the summary, offer the detail) |
| **Product** | User impact, adoption metrics, feature velocity | Cost structures that aren't their domain |

**5. The one-page format.** The business case fits one page or it isn't understood:

```markdown
## Business case: <initiative name>

**The problem costs:** <one line, quantified>
**The investment:** <hours and cost>
**The return:** <quantified, with time horizon>
**Payback:** <months from realizable cash benefits, or not established>
**Sensitivity:** <the 1-2 drivers that swing it, with thresholds>
**Risks:** <what must be true for this to hold>
**Recommendation:** <proceed / proceed-with-conditions / defer>
```

## Artifact

**`business-case.md`** - the one-page case. Lives alongside `success.md` and `reality.md` as a first-class engagement artifact. Referenced by plan, status, and close.

**`decisions.md`** - log the sponsor's response: approved, modified, deferred. With the date.

## Checkpoint

Walk the FDE through: the cost of doing nothing (anchor), the investment, the return, and the one sensitivity that matters most. If the FDE says "the sponsor won't buy the ROI number," inspect the disputed inputs and sources, test plausible ranges, and identify what measurement would resolve the disagreement. Never reverse-engineer assumptions to hit a desired number.

## Worked example

Acme phase 2 needs funding. The case starts with the cost of doing nothing, not the cost of building.

Anchor: two silent failures since March, each one day of finance reconciliation by hand plus a late close (`reality.md`, Marco's sheet). That is the number the sponsor already believes because her own team reported it.

Driver model the sponsor can trace: incidents/quarter × hours of manual reconciliation × loaded cost, plus the tail risk of a late regulatory close - stated separately, because mixing a certain small number with an uncertain large one is how a case loses credibility.

Sensitivity names the two drivers that swing it: incident frequency (2/quarter → 1/quarter and the case halves) and whether the manual re-run continues in parallel (if Marco keeps re-running every morning, the saving is theoretical). The second one is the honest weakness, so it is in the case rather than waiting to be found in the room - with the condition that makes it hold: the morning re-run stops after two clean cycles, agreed with Marco.

## Principles

- The cost of doing nothing is always the opening move. Anchor before proposing.
- Driver models with visible arithmetic beat magic spreadsheets.
- Name the sensitivity. The case that admits its weakness earns more trust.
- One page. If it doesn't fit, you don't understand it yet.
- A business case the FDE can't explain in 60 seconds won't survive the sponsor's boss.
